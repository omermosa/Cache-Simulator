# Cache-Simulator
#### This project was a part of Computer Organization Course at the American University in Cairo (AUC)

This Cpp Program Simulates the different Computer Cache Policies (e.g., LRU, LFU) and types (Fully Associative, Direct Mapping, Set Associative) and their interaction. This is done through 6 Experiments, each one of them testing different Memory addresses, different policies, or different types...etc.
